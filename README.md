# database-assignment
The difficulties that I am seeing in the Average time spent by a user in social media are;
Theres alot of redundance od data in the file hence giving the database administrator alot of work in repeting the task.
In locating someones age because they are not arranged in ascending order.


The one interesting thing is that female users do not own cars.
